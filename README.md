# Pirate Musician

A music education platform that provides tutorials and exercises for ear training and music theory. One of the most basic exercises is interval identification, where two different tones are played and the listener has to identify the amount of distance between them.

## Demo

Will be adding a Firebase link soon

## Current Features

* Interval identification exercises

## Future Features

* Add ability to change various settings during the exercises (e.g. difficulty level, playback tempo, etc.)
* Add pitch recognition module
* Add melodic dictation module (listener is played a melody and then they have to write it down)
* Add chord recognition exercises
* Add other stuff I haven't thot of yet

## Built With

* [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) - The web framework used
